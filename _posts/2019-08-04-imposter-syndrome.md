There is a common misconception that imposter syndrome is simply a lack of
confidence. It's not. It's a continued lack of confidence, in the face of alternative evidence, and
usually sustained by external forces.

It's entirely normal to lack confidence when in a completely new and unfamiliar
situation, like when you get that first big break in your career. If handled
correctly, that can even be a helpful feeling to have.

However, it's not normal to feel the same way six months later when you're doing
some really good work at that company (for example). That's when imposter syndrome comes into
play.

There are many reasons why you might doubt your accomplishments and lack
confidence in that situation. It might be you've not been receiving the feedback you need. You might not have
been given the right sort of tasks to help you learn and grow. You might be the
only woman on the team and be greeted each morning at stand up with "Hello
gents". You may find yourself surrounded by peers who talk about obscure terms
or algorithms never actually used but learned at University, when you don't have a degree. All these things can be small, persistent indicators that you don't quite belong and ultimately affect your belief in your own abilities.

That means that things like race, gender, sexual orientation and even your social background 
can play a significant part in the development of imposter syndrome. Since those things can affect how you are perceived, how competent you appear and how much you 'fit in' with the group.

All too often we put the onus on the individual to solve these problems for themselves, rather than looking at the environment they are in. This can create extra pressure for someone already disadvanged by the situation. So instead, I leave you with this question:

How do we challenge those external factors and create an environment within our teams where it's harder for imposter syndrome to take hold?
